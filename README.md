	Pitch:	    As the leading Phoenix painter, Beautiful America Painting provides a wide 
		    array of interior and exterior painting services for residential projects.  
		    As any good painter knows, there are many ways to bring out the beauty of your 
		    living space.  A fresh coat of paint can do wonders for a room or your home. 
		    If you are looking to liven up the atmosphere, a change of color(s) can make a 
		    world of difference.

		    When searching for a House Painter in Phoenix, quality must be the utmost 
		    importance.  Paint provides beauty abd elegance, as well as protection from 
		    elements.  By painting your home, you can add value and make a great first 
	  	    impression...what realtors call 'Curb appeal" which is essential if you plan on 
		    selling your home.  However, not every Phoenix painter is dedicated to quality like 
		    Beautiful America Painting.

		    Once you contact us, we will set up an agreed upon time to visit you.  At that time,
		    we will answer any questions, and provide you with a written estimate. Unlike many 
	   	    other Phoenix painters, we always ask that the homeowner be present at the time of 
		    the estimate so that any and all concerns can be addressed. 

	FAQ:	    -Is there any fee for an estimate?
		    -Are there any persistent follow up calls, junk mail, or email, from which it is 
		     impossible to unsubscribe after the estimate?
		    -How long does it  take to get a free estimate?
		    -Can I get an estimate on the same day I call?
		    -If we agree on the price how soon can I start?
